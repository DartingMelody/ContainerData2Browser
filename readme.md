This repository can be used to get the data from python/node containers to the browser.

For python developers, follow these guidelines:
    
    1. Create a virtual environment (For reference: https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
    2. Run script in this virtual environment
    3. The script should be formatted as script_init.py
    4. Run "pip freeze > requirements.txt" in terminal
    5. Push new folder with script and requirements.txt. Give the folder and script the same name.
Presently, this app is supporting only two environments python3 and node js. 

Other environments can be added too. Feel free to contribute.
